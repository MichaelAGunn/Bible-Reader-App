# Bible-Reader-App

This app will display any set of queried verses in the Bible. I intend to include as many translations as possible, and the apocrypha will be available.
I intend to add sentiment analysis and visualization tools once the basic reader is finished.
This app will be free of charge and freely available for Windows Desktop, Android, and maybe iOS.

To start, I will be using public domain translations in English. Special thanks to scrollmapper for his bible_databases project.

I'll eventually expand into more contemporary translations and I will include some translations from other languages.

According to Canada's Copyright Act, it is not infringement to make a private copy for personal use, or a backup copy of any copyrighted work (even without authorization). It's also permissable to make and distribute as many copies of a work as is necessary for the purposes of private study, research, and education, among others (again, without authorization). These exceptions to copyright are meant to be broadly construed: see Supreme Court decisions including CCH v Law Society (2004) and SOCAN v Bell (2013).
